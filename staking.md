# Staking

However, a userâ€™s slashing risk with the original validator remains until the unbonding period concludes. For example, a user stakes 20 DYDX to validator A for 59 days, on day 60 the user decides to redelegate their 20 DYDX to validator B. If validator A is slashed between days 60-90, the user is at a risk of having a portion of their 20 staked DYDX slashed. After the 90th day, the slashing risk transitions to validator B.
