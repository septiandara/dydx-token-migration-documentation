# GovernanceStrategyV2 Smart Contract

The dYdX

[`GovernanceStrategy Smart` Contract](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/master/contracts/governance/GovernanceStrategy.sol)

and the

[GovernanceStrategyV2 Smart Contract](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/master/contracts/governance/strategy/GovernanceStrategyV2.sol)

determine the proposal and voting power of each individual address at a specific block number. This

[GovernanceStrategyV2 Smart Contract](https://github.com/dydxfoundation/governance-contracts/blob/master/contracts/governance/strategy/GovernanceStrategyV2.sol)

weighs the proposal and voting power from ethDYDX, stkDYDX and wethDYDX tokens equally. In addition to being considered for on-chain voting, this contract is also used by Snapshot to determine a given user's voting power and/or proposal power for off-chain voting.
