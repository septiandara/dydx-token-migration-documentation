DYDX (hereinafter "`ethDYDX`"), a governance token that allows the dYdX community to govern certain aspects of the dYdX Layer 2 protocol on Ethereum (“dYdX v3”) to align incentives between traders, liquidity providers, and partners. The `ethDYDX` token enables a robust ecosystem around governance, rewards, and staking - each of which is designed to drive future growth and decentralization of dYdX v3.
