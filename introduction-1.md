# Introduction

Validators will need to provide Ethereum RPC endpoint as a flag in the start command, instead of in a config file. Eventually, the URL of the node can be stored in the configuration file of the given validator. Ideally, this node is run by the validator themselves, but it could also be a hosted node from Alchemy or Infura. Ideally, to achieve a decentralized network, no more than 1/3 of the stake weight should use any one centralized service.
